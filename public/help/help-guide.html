            <summary>Who is Refugees Welcome! ?</summary>

            <p>Refugees Welcome! is a 501(c)3 nonprofit embedded in the University of Massachusetts Boston’s Center for Peace, Development, and Democracy. [RW!]’s <b>mission is to strengthen and streamline immigrant and refugee services across the greater Boston area.</b> The organization does this by engaging with migrant service providers through a participatory line of inquiry to solve the most pressing issues facing migrants in our city. [RW!] serves as a platform for organizing immigrant and refugee services, provides capacity building trainings for organizations, advocates for the expansion of immigrant and refugee services, and assists service providers by helping to fill any programmatic gaps through connecting them with resources, developing new initiatives, and supporting their work.</p>

            <p>To assist refugee service providers, Refugees Welcome! focuses on five thematic areas (or teams): Research, Communication, Capacity Building, Technology, and Grant Writing and Fundraising. The Leadership Team, Research Fellows, and Interns work on specific teams to develop programmatic activities that are geared towards our clients&rsquo; needs.</p>

                Why did we create the Migrant Service Map?
            </summary>

            <p>The Migrant Service Map is an interactive mapping tool designed to streamline common workflows for service providers who assist immigrant and refugee communities.  It helps providers locate organizations in Boston – such as community centers, education resources, legal and healthcare assistance – and share these with their clients.</p>

            <p>Built in 2019, the map is a result of <a href="https://refugeeswelcomehome.org/">Refugees Welcome!&rsquo;s</a> ongoing research into methods to improve immigrant and refugee service provision.  Development has been a joint effort between <a href="https://refugeeswelcomehome.org/">Refugees Welcome!</a>, the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/community/">MapBox Community Development Office</a>, and <a href="https://www.codeforboston.org/">Code for Boston</a>.</p>

            <p>The map is populated by a list of approved locations compiled by Refugees Welcome! and contains up to date contact information for the organizations included.</p>
        </details>

            <summary> What&rsquo;s next? </summary>
            The upgraded Migrant Service Map would include features that were identified by 35 immigrant service providers, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete control over user content, removing Refugee&rsquo;s Welcome! as the data collector, allowing for organizations to update their information in real time through the creation of an online portal where each organization would receive its own user profile</li>
                <li>Profile forms ensure uniformity among descriptive information on immigrant service provision allowing for streamline of information</li>
                <li>Signaling feature within the pop-up that allows organizations to signal whether or not they are taking on more clients</li>
                <li>Strategic anonymous pop-up surveys to collect data on issues relevant to immigrant service provision and immigration needs across time and space</li>
                <li>Calendar sharing for events and strengthening networks</li>
                <li>And messaging system for client referrals across service types.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional features to allow providers to add, edit and update their own information as well as expanding to new locations are in the project’s roadmap, and depend on funding.</p>

                When will you offer this in [my city]? 
            </summary>
            <p> Our Research Team is searching for funding to expand the application’s borders beyond Boston – to multiple nonprofit fields and cities. </p>

        <details> 
            <summary> Future Plans </summary>
            <p> Moving forward, the project will solicit nonprofits across Boston for feedback during every product management phase to make the application easily accessible and usable by immigration service providers.

                What can I do with the Migrant Service Map?
            </summary>
            <p>The Migrant Service Map helps migrant service providers explore the organizations serving immigrant and refugee communities in the Boston area.  They can then make personalized recommendations for their clients, based on the type of assistance an organization offers and its location convenience.</p>

            <p>Providers can use the map to:
            <ul>
                <li>Easily search for services by type, location</li>
                                
                <li>Pop-up information about each organization</li>
                                
                <li>Create, manage, and send lists of services with email, address, phone number, and website to migrant clients</li>
                
            </ul></p>
