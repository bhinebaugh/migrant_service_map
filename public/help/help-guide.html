            <summary>What is the Migrant Service Map?</summary>
            <p>The Migrant Service Map is an interactive mapping tool designed to streamline common workflows for service providers who assist immigrant communities.  It helps providers locate organizations in Boston – such as community centers, education resources, legal and healthcare assistance – and share these with their clients.</p>
            <p>Built in 2019, the map is a result of Refugee’s Welcome!’s ongoing research into methods to improve immigrant service provision.  Development has been a joint effort between Refugees Welcome!, the MapBox Community Development Office, and Code for Boston.</p>

            <summary>What can I do with the map?</summary>
            <p>The Migrant Service Map helps migrant service providers explore the organizations serving immigrant communities in the Boston area.  They can then make personalized recommendations for their clients, based on the type of assistance an organization offers and its location convenience.</p>

            <p>Providers can use the map to:
            <ul>
                <li>Easily search for services by type, location, and legal status;</li>
                                
                <li>Pop-up information about each organization;</li>
                                
                <li>Add to cart – a feature that allows immigrant service providers to create, manage, and send lists of services with email, address, phone number, and maps to migrant clients;</li>
                                
                <li>And scroll to view non-georeferenced organizations who do not have physical locations so every organization can participate.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>The map is populated by a list of approved locations compiled by Refugees Welcome! and contains up to date contact information for the organizations included.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>How is your information about providers curated? &nbsp;What type of providers are available?</summary>
            <p>Refugees Welcome! compiled up to date information for the service providers included in the map.  Additional features to allow providers to add, edit and update their own information are in the project’s roadmap and expand to new locations, funding dependent.

            <summary>What is Refugees Welcome?</summary>
            <p>Refugees Welcome! is a 501(c)3 nonprofit embedded in the University of Massachusetts Boston&rsquo;s Center for Peace, Development, and Democracy. [RW!]&rsquo;s mission is to strengthen and streamline immigrant and refugee services across the greater Boston area. The organization does this by engaging with migrant service providers through a participatory line of inquiry to solve the most pressing issues facing migrants in our city. [RW!] serves as a platform for organizing immigrant and refugee services, provides capacity building trainings for organizations, advocates for the expansion of immigrant and refugee services, and assists service providers by helping to fill any programmatic gaps through connecting them with resources, developing new initiatives, and supporting their work.</p>
            <p>To assist refugee service providers, Refugees Welcome! focuses on five thematic areas (or teams); Research, Communication, Capacity Building, Technology, and Grant Writing and Fundraising. Board Members, Research Fellows, and Interns work on specific teams to develop programmatic activities that are geared towards our clients&rsquo; needs.</p>

            <summary>What&rsquo;s next? When will you offer this in [My City]?</summary>
            Our Research Team is searching for funding to expand the application&rsquo;s borders beyond Boston to multiple nonprofit fields and cities. The upgraded Migrant Service Map would include features that were identified by 35 immigrant service providers, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete control over user content, removing Refugee&rsquo;s Welcome! as the data collector, allowing for organizations to update their information in real time through the creation of an online portal where each organization would receive its own user profile;</li>
                <li>Profile forms ensure uniformity among descriptive information on immigrant service provision allowing for streamline of information;</li>
                <li>Signaling feature within the pop-up that allows organizations to signal whether or not they are taking on more clients;</li>
                <li>Strategic anonymous pop-up surveys to collect data on issues relevant to immigrant service provision and immigration needs across time and space;</li>
                <li>Calendar sharing for events and strengthening networks;</li>
                <li>And messaging system for client referrals across service types.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Moving forward, the project will solicit nonprofits across Boston for feedback during every product management phase to make the application easily accessible and usable by immigration service providers.</p>
